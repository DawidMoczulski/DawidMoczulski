## Hello! 👋

I’m a fourth-year Applied Computer Science student at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.
 
My passionates are frontend or backend development, music and creating visual tools for education. ⚡

I specialize in web technologies such as React and ASP.NET Core. I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems and help users.

I’m constantly improving my programming skills by learning new technologies and working on team projects.💻

Feel free to check out my projects! 🚀
